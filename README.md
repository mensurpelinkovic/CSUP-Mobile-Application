WEATHERCASEAPP

A network for those who care about the air.

### Project Overview
WeatherCaseApp (WCA) offers its users a unique opportunity to become a member of a community of environmental influencers. WCA collects data from meteorological and pollution sensors and makes it visible in the app and on the web. But moreover, WCA is not just a network of sensors, it’s a network of people gathered around same interests and values. WCA allows it’s users to communicate with each other and to create a social network of people interested in the matters of climate, meteorology and environment. Users are able to create personal profiles where they can publish their sensors measurements and to express their interests, thoughts, ideas and solutions. They can interact and communicate with each other. That way, WCA can become a platform for future influencers that might trigger wide changes or, at least, offer new solutions for existing problems, especially in the area of air pollution. Personalized experience is guaranteed by a wide range of options for adding functionalities and fine tuning of the design by, for example, choosing a cover photo and selecting a profile photo. For those users who are in possession of a sensors, WCA enables to closely monitor all parameters like temperature, air pressure and humidity, but also AQI index that illustrates air pollution. All collected data is displayed in the app numerically and graphically. WCA users can compare collected data and analyze interdisciplinary influence of all parameters or simply share data with WCA community.
